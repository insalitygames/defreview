# DefReview

This is small native extension for [Defold engine](http://www.defold.com) which allows to use [native iOS Ratings and Reviews window](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/system-capabilities/ratings-and-reviews/) and [Google Play In-App Review API](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review).
